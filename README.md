# aicoss-autocar3g-winner
Winner solution for the AI COSS Autonomous Driving Robot Competition using CNN-based line tracing and decision-making algorithms.
# AI COSS Autonomous Driving Robot (Winner)

## Overview
This project is an autonomous driving robot system developed for the AI COSS Autonomous Driving Competition.
The goal was to maximize reward by combining camera-based line tracing with a decision-making algorithm
under real-world constraints (Jetson Nano, real-time inference).

## Key Features
- CNN-based line tracing (Jetson Nano optimized)
- Two-Armed Bandit based decision making at intersections
- YOLO-based object detection for reward acquisition
- Real-world deployment on AutoCar3G platform

## Tech Stack
- Python, PyTorch / Keras
- Jetson Nano
- YOLOv8
- Two-Armed Bandit (UCB, Ensemble Policy)

## Results
- 🏆 Winner of AI COSS Autonomous Driving Competition (External)
- Stable multi-lap driving with reward-maximizing decisions
